TROLL SERVER
============

A simple and small Web Server written in Bash. It's just a college assignment,
so it is not really intended to use at production at all, neither at serious
development. Currently, it can handle some CGI, PHP and, of course, plain HTML.

It requires **socat** and **php5-cgi** to work. To test it, just run *server.sh*
as root.
